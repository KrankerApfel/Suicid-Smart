# About the game

Type: Coordination, puzzle, plateformer

You wanna go to the exit but ennemies block the road. The only way to kill them is...commit suicid by explode on it !
But don't worry, you can use a clone box to have a couple of clones. The first one is named Obedient and do the same movement as you. The second is Stubborn and will move the opposite (like a mirror). Spawner are disposed on different zones in the map,
you have to choose wich clone do you want to spawn on it. You must action doors and plateforms to help your clones to
reach ennemies, and your clones help you by secure exit pathways.

Controls :

_ arrow keys to move
_ space bar to jump
_ top arrow to choose clone
_ enter to validate
_ R to restart

PS : option scrollbars bug because of my shader, use input box to change volume
